# Bank_transactions

This Dataset consists of a million bank transaction records. 
I have analysed this dataset and used the K-means clustering algorithm to derive meaningful insight by grouping the data as I have seen fit.
Please feel free to provide feedback on this analysis and how I can improve my approach...

Thank you!
